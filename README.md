# Edene

Edene is a Design System which actually contains the foundations (core) and two implementations written in Typescript.

-   Foundations: Includes all the necessary to be used as a Design System for your applications. It contains tokens, which represent the shared values that maintain consistency across our system
-   Components: a list of reusable React components
-   Hooks: a list of hooks which will help _components_ and your applications

Edene is not only a component library, but goes far beyond that.

## Use anywhere
