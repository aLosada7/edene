# Getting started

## Welcome! 🤗 🎊 🤝

Thank you for looking at the Docs!

## Installation

Our Design System lives in [this repository](https://github.com/aLosada7/edene). It is written in TypeScript, but you can still use our code even if your application is written in JavaScript.

This guide assumes you have some familiarity with React and Babel. Setting up a React project from scratch is outside the scope of this guide.

We recommend installing the following packages:

-   `react`
-   `@emotion/react`
-   `@emotion/styled`

```shell
$ yarn add react @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

> See [Using Emotion](https://guardian.github.io/source/?path=/docs/docs-04-using-emotion--page) for guidance on how to configure Babel to use Emotion's css prop.

## Components

We publish the library with components written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/).

```shell
$ npm install @edene/foundations @edene/components @edene/hooks
```

_Hooks library is necessary to be installed along components at this point_

You also need to add support for [Google Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Icons). Add to your HTML

```html
<link
    rel="stylesheet"
    type="text/css"
    href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons|Material+Icons+Outlined"
/>
```

Or optionally to your SCSS.

```scss
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons|Material+Icons+Outlined');
```

Then use to import the Accordion:

```typescript
import { Accordion, AccordionRow } from '@edene/components';
```
