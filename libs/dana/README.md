# Intro

> Installing our shared components and utilities into your application.

## Welcome! 🤗 🎊 🤝

Thank you for looking at the Docs!

## Install

Our library for the web lives in this repository. It is written in TypeScript, but you can still use our code even if your application is written in JavaScript.

This guide assumes you have some familiarity with React and Babel. Setting up a React project from scratch is outside the scope of this guide.

We recommend installing the following packages:

-   `react`
-   `@emotion/react`

```shell
$ yarn add react@^17.0.1 @emotion/react@^11.1.2
```

> See [Using Emotion](https://guardian.github.io/source/?path=/docs/docs-04-using-emotion--page) for guidance on how to configure Babel to use Emotion's css prop.

## Components

We publish the library with components written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/).

```shell
$ npm install @dana
```

Then use to import the Accordion:

```typescript
import { Accordion, AccordionRow } from '@edene/components';
```
