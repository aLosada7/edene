# Theme

## Default themes and wrap your application

The theme props are defined by Theme type

By default, the theme is based in pink colors. Any of the props of the default theme can be overwritten passing its new value to the theme prop.

```tsx

import { Theme, ThemeProvider } from '@edene/foundations';

const theme: Partial<Theme> = {
    white: #000;
}

export const App = () (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}></Theme>
)
```

There are _two_ more themes exported within the library, which can completely override the default theme.

-   Blue theme `import { blueTheme } from '@edene/foundations';`
-   Teal theme `import { tealTheme } from '@edene/foundations';`

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider, tealTheme } from '@edene/foundations';

export const App = () (
    <ThemeProvider theme={tealTheme}></Theme>
)
```

## Hook

To make use of the provider values in the entire application you can use the _useTheme_ hook.

This hook return the theme value and a method to change the theme value.

```tsx
const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme();
```
