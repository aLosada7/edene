# Theme

By default, the theme is based in pink colors.

There are _two_ more themes exported within the library, which can completely override the default theme.

-   Blue theme `import { blueTheme } from '@edene/foundations';`
-   Teal theme `import { tealTheme } from '@edene/foundations';`

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider, tealTheme } from '@edene/foundations';

export const App = () (
    <ThemeProvider theme={tealTheme}></Theme>
)
```

Besides, you can create your own themes. Any of the props of the default theme can be overwritten passing a new value to the theme prop.

```tsx

import { Theme, ThemeProvider } from '@edene/foundations';

const theme: Partial<Theme> = {
    white: #000;
}

export const App = () (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}></Theme>
)
```

## Hook

To make use of the provider values in the entire application you can use the _useTheme_ hook.

This hook return the theme value and a method to programatically change the theme value.

```tsx
const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme();
```
