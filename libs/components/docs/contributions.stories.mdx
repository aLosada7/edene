# Contribute

Everyone is invited to contribute.

We highly recommend you to clone the repository in your machine.

You can use Dev containers to use the shared development environment

For each bug/feature a new branch has to be added to the repository (from master branch).

Remember:

-   Each component should have a playground (whenever is possible) and it has to allow playing with as many properties as possible.
-   There is one default story, and different stories to simulate the behaviour of each property.
    -   If the property is a boolean or text value, the story name has to be _With\*_ being \* the property name. For example: WithIcon.
    -   If there are different values, the story name should be _\*_ with the first letter in uppercase. For example: Types.
-   Before adding modifications in tokens, there should be an analysis thread first and it must be approved.
-   Pull Requests has to be approved by one of the repository owners (because this is a small community). A pipeline with automatic tests will be triggered and there will be run extra checks in Chromatic.
